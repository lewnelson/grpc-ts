# Generated client examples

The `grpc-ts` CLI tool will generate the output from [grpc-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grpc-tools) as well as creating a client class which uses the [GenericClient](../generic_client/README.md) under the hood to make requests.

The client class method names are a 1:1 mapping of the methods defined in the generated client class on the `_grpc_pb.d.ts` files.
